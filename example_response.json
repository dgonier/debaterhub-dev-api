      "text": "Private property rights: In contrast to Australia and most other jurisdictions around the world where the state retains subsurface mineral rights, as a general rule in the United States, property owners have the right to extract natural gas that lies under the surface of their property. Of course, this also means that owners also have the right to reject proposals from developers. But this is exactly the point of well-defined, enforceable property rights to subsurface minerals and other resources: they reduce transaction costs31 and the possibility of the tragedy of the anticommons.32 This increases the likelihood that resources can flow to their most valuable uses (whether that means resource extraction or leaving resources in the ground). Where it is efficient for resource extraction to take place, the US property rights system increases incentives for development and resource exploitation, in the form of leasing and royalty arrangements and outright sales.\nWell-developed existing gas pipeline infrastructure and natural gas storage facilities: The United States has more than 210 separate existing natural gas pipeline systems, which together form a network of nearly 500,000 km of gas transmission. There are more than 11,000 delivery points, 1,400 interconnection points and 400 underground natural gas storage facilities. This vast existing infrastructure means that newly discovered gas can be rapidly transported to wherever it is needed. And storage facilities aid the efficient use of gas over time. There are around 30 gas transmission pipelines on the Australian east coast, with total length of around 20,000 km. There are eight storage facilities (not including storage in pipelines themselves). As a result of privatisation sales in the 1990s, the sector is fully privately owned.\nPipeline regulation arrangements: Under a series of US federal deregulatory measures that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, gas wellhead prices were deregulated and price ceilings were removed. Pipeline services were unbundled from gas sales, and an open access pipeline regime was introduced. Rate of return regulation for interstate pipeline pricing also came into effect.\nThe United States\u2019 relatively large fleet of Combined-Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) Generators: The United States has a newer and more efficient gas generation fleet, with a higher percentage of combined cycle gas turbines designed to run continuously as baseload generators. Since 2000, most of the additions to the US generation fleet have been CCGT plants, with CCGT capacity more than doubling over the period. CCGT now accounts for 23.6 per cent of overall generating capacity in the United States, compared to only 6.1 per cent in Australia. In contrast to open-cycle gas-turbines (OCGT), which are primarily used for peaking, CCGT is used as a baseload generation source. CCGT capacity factors have been increasing in the United States, and now match or exceed those of coal in many areas. CCGT is a relatively energy-efficient technology,33 with relatively short construction time and low construction costs compared with other baseload generation sources, wind and solar (measured on a dollar cost per unit of installed capacity basis).34 However, the relative economic attractiveness of CCGT [measured on a levelised cost (LCOE) basis] is sensitive to assumptions about fuel costs. For example, the Finkel Review, using data from AGL, argued that at a gas price of A$8/GJ, CCGT has a lower LCOE than firmed wind or solar, but that the ranking is reversed for a gas price of A$12/GJ.35",

Retrieved from Google</a><div class=\"subheading\">The potential for nuclear escalation underscores the importance of maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent to prevent conflict from escalating to a nuclear level.</div><p>A Taiwan invasion would be unprecedented: a high-intensity armed conflict between two nuclear-armed major powers. The leaders of both sides would face challenges to nuclear deterrence that no one has faced before. Each side\u2019s stake in the outcome of such a conflict would be very high. A Chinese defeat could pose an existential internal political threat to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and result in Taiwanese independence. A US and allied defeat could undermine US-led alliances in Asia and Europe, and fundamentally undermine the US and allied strategic position in Asia. Chinese occupation of Taiwan would transform that island from a geographic constraint on China\u2019s military operations to a platform from which to project power further. And the incorporation of Taiwan\u2019s economic capacity would further strengthen the PRC. Both sides would try to deter the other prewar and intrawar. The United States would seek first to deter the invasion and then Chinese nuclear escalation if China were losing in the conflict. China would seek first to deter US and allied intervention in the conflict, and then US nuclear escalation if China was winning. The conflict would be fought on a scale and with an intensity that would severely test both Chinese and US, allied, and partner conventional forces, potentially to the breaking point. That scale and intensity would mean either side might consider the limited use of nuclear weapons to secure victory or prevent defeat. Both sides have escalation options short of nuclear weapons use that create potentially decisive strategic level dilemmas for the other. China has space and cyber options that could degrade US power projection. Chinese leadership also might be able to prompt Russian (or North Korean) opportunistic or collaborative aggression, stressing the US military\u2019s ability to fight two major conflicts against nuclear-armed adversaries simultaneously. The Chinese invasion of Taiwan could be the first or second of those conflicts to initiate (i.e., the Taiwan invasion itself could take the form of opportunistic aggression). Those scenarios pose very different challenges to US strategy and forces. The United States and its allies have space and cyber options to degrade Chinese conventional operations, plus the option to blockade shipping to and from China outside the reach of China\u2019s navy and air force. <span class=\"underline\">These nonnuclear escalation options raise the prospect of nuclear escalation in response.</span> The conflict could become protracted if China fails in its initial effort to seize Taiwan but refuses to terminate the conflict. <span class=\"underline\">The prospect of a protracted conflict could prompt either side to consider nuclear escalation to bring the conflict to a favorable or acceptable conclusion should either party determine that a protracted war is not in its interest.</span> By 2027, China\u2019s nuclear force will likely have grown to approximately seven hundred deployed warheads, most of them capable of ranging the United States, giving it a more secure second strike against the US homeland and significant new theater nuclear strike options. While not yet a quantitative \u201cpeer\u201d in 2027, a nuclear force of this size is a far greater threat than what the United States faced just a year or two ago. Finally, perhaps the most defining operational feature of the Taiwan invasion scenario is that it requires the Chinese military to conduct an opposed amphibious and airborne assault across 80-125 nautical miles of ocean onto an island with a population of 23.5 million people, approximately 170,000 active-duty military, and nearly 1.6 million reservists. This is a daunting prospect for China, especially in the face of US and allied military intervention. Current US joint doctrine for amphibious operations states: \u201cThe assault is the most difficult type of amphibious operation and one of the most difficult of all military operations due to its complexity\u201d (emphasis added).6Joint Publication 3-02, Amphibious Operations, Joint Chiefs of Staff, January 4, 2019, validated without change on January 21, 2021, II-9.

Retrieved from Google</a><div class=\"subheading\">The increase in energy prices has been linked to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions, leading to higher costs for consumers, especially those in lower-income brackets.</div><p><span class=\"underline\">Energy prices have been rising since 2021 because of the rapid economic recovery, weather conditions in various parts of the world, maintenance work that had been delayed by the pandemic, and earlier decisions by oil and gas companies and exporting countries to reduce investments.</span> <span class=\"underline\">Russia began withholding gas supplies to Europe in 2021, months ahead of its invasion of Ukraine.</span> Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine greatly exacerbated the situation. <span class=\"underline\">The United States and the EU imposed a series of sanctions on Russia and many European countries declared their intention to phase out Russian gas imports completely.</span> Meanwhile, Russia has increasingly curtailed or even turned off its export pipelines. Russia is by far the world\u2019s largest exporter of fossil fuels, and a particularly important supplier to Europe. In 2021, a quarter of all energy consumed in the EU came from Russia. As Europe sought to replace Russian gas, it bid up prices of US, Australian and Qatari ship-borne liquefied natural gas (LNG), raising prices and diverting supply away from traditional LNG customers in Asia. <span class=\"underline\">Because gas frequently sets the price at which electricity is sold, power prices soared as well.</span> Both LNG producers and importers are rushing to build new infrastructure to increase how much LNG can be traded internationally, but these costly projects take years to come online. Oil prices also initially soared as international trade routes were reconfigured after the United States, many European countries and some of their Asian allies said they would no longer buy Russian oil. Some shippers have declined to carry Russian oil because of sanctions and insurance risk. Many large oil producers were unable to boost supply to meet rising demand \u2013 even with the incentive of sky-high prices \u2013 because of a lack of investment in recent years. While prices have come down from their peaks, the outlook is uncertain with new rounds of European sanctions on Russia kicking in later this year.</p></div>",

Of course, this also means that owners also have the right to reject proposals from developers. But this is exactly the point of well-defined, enforceable property rights to subsurface minerals and other resources: they reduce transaction costs31 and the possibility of the tragedy of the anticommons.32 This increases the likelihood that resources can flow to their most valuable uses (whether that means resource extraction or leaving resources in the ground). Where it is efficient for resource extraction to take place, the US property rights system increases incentives for development and resource exploitation, in the form of leasing and royalty arrangements and outright sales. Well-developed existing gas pipeline infrastructure and natural gas storage facilities: The United States has more than 210 separate existing natural gas pipeline systems, which together form a network of nearly 500,000 km of gas transmission. There are more than 11,000 delivery points, 1,400 interconnection points and 400 underground natural gas storage facilities. This vast existing infrastructure means that newly discovered gas can be rapidly transported to wherever it is needed. And storage facilities aid the efficient use of gas over time. There are around 30 gas transmission pipelines on the Australian east coast, with total length of around 20,000 km. There are eight storage facilities (not including storage in pipelines themselves). As a result of privatisation sales in the 1990s, the sector is fully privately owned. Pipeline regulation arrangements: Under a series of US federal deregulatory measures that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, gas wellhead prices were deregulated and price ceilings were removed. Pipeline services were unbundled from gas sales, and an open access pipeline regime was introduced. Rate of return regulation for interstate pipeline pricing also came into effect. The United States\u2019 relatively large fleet of Combined-Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) Generators: The United States has a newer and more efficient gas generation fleet, with a higher percentage of combined cycle gas turbines designed to run continuously as baseload generators. Since 2000, most of the additions to the US generation fleet have been CCGT plants, with CCGT capacity more than doubling over the period. CCGT now accounts for 23.6 per cent of overall generating capacity in the United States, compared to only 6.1 per cent in Australia. In contrast to open-cycle gas-turbines (OCGT), which are primarily used for peaking, CCGT is used as a baseload generation source. CCGT capacity factors have been increasing in the United States, and now match or exceed those of coal in many areas. CCGT is a relatively energy-efficient technology,33 with relatively short construction time and low construction costs compared with other baseload generation sources, wind and solar (measured on a dollar cost per unit of installed capacity basis).34 However, the relative economic attractiveness of CCGT [measured on a levelised cost (LCOE) basis] is sensitive to assumptions about fuel costs. For example, the Finkel Review, using data from AGL, argued that at a gas price of A$8/GJ, CCGT has a lower LCOE than firmed wind or solar, but that the ranking is reversed for a gas price of A$12/GJ.35.</p></div>\n            </div>\n        \n            <div class=\"card\">\n                <div id=\"caa218a4-825d-5386-9d06-61b0d0c67c2a\"><div class=\"claim\" >The Chinese military is preparing to invade Taiwan by 2027, which poses a significant threat to regional stability.</div><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/the-role-of-nuclear-weapons-in-a-taiwan-crisis/\" id=71e67111-49a8-5047-b8bd-703dccdd65b0>The role of nuclear weapons in a Taiwan crisis - Atlantic Council : https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/the-role-of-nuclear-weapons-in-a-taiwan-crisis/.

The leaders of both sides would face challenges to nuclear deterrence that no one has faced before. Each side\u2019s stake in the outcome of such a conflict would be very high. A Chinese defeat could pose an existential internal political threat to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and result in Taiwanese independence. A US and allied defeat could undermine US-led alliances in Asia and Europe, and fundamentally undermine the US and allied strategic position in Asia. Chinese occupation of Taiwan would transform that island from a geographic constraint on China\u2019s military operations to a platform from which to project power further. And the incorporation of Taiwan\u2019s economic capacity would further strengthen the PRC. Both sides would try to deter the other prewar and intrawar. The United States would seek first to deter the invasion and then Chinese nuclear escalation if China were losing in the conflict. China would seek first to deter US and allied intervention in the conflict, and then US nuclear escalation if China was winning. The conflict would be fought on a scale and with an intensity that would severely test both Chinese and US, allied, and partner conventional forces, potentially to the breaking point. That scale and intensity would mean either side might consider the limited use of nuclear weapons to secure victory or prevent defeat. Both sides have escalation options short of nuclear weapons use that create potentially decisive strategic level dilemmas for the other. China has space and cyber options that could degrade US power projection. Chinese leadership also might be able to prompt Russian (or North Korean) opportunistic or collaborative aggression, stressing the US military\u2019s ability to fight two major conflicts against nuclear-armed adversaries simultaneously. The Chinese invasion of Taiwan could be the first or second of those conflicts to initiate (i.e., the Taiwan invasion itself could take the form of opportunistic aggression). Those scenarios pose very different challenges to US strategy and forces. The United States and its allies have space and cyber options to degrade Chinese conventional operations, plus the option to blockade shipping to and from China outside the reach of China\u2019s navy and air force. <span class=\"underline\">These nonnuclear escalation options raise the prospect of nuclear escalation in response.</span> The conflict could become protracted if China fails in its initial effort to seize Taiwan but refuses to terminate the conflict. <span class=\"underline\">The prospect of a protracted conflict could prompt either side to consider nuclear escalation to bring the conflict to a favorable or acceptable conclusion should either party determine that a protracted war is not in its interest.</span> By 2027, China\u2019s nuclear force will likely have grown to approximately seven hundred deployed warheads, most of them capable of ranging the United States, giving it a more secure second strike against the US homeland and significant new theater nuclear strike options. While not yet a quantitative \u201cpeer\u201d in 2027, a nuclear force of this size is a far greater threat than what the United States faced just a year or two ago. Finally, perhaps the most defining operational feature of the Taiwan invasion scenario is that it requires the Chinese military to conduct an opposed amphibious and airborne assault across 80-125 nautical miles of ocean onto an island with a population of 23.5 million people, approximately 170,000 active-duty military, and nearly 1.6 million reservists. This is a daunting prospect for China, especially in the face of US and allied military intervention. Current US joint doctrine for amphibious operations states: \u201cThe assault is the most difficult type of amphibious operation and one of the most difficult of all military operations due to its complexity\u201d (emphasis added).6Joint Publication 3-02, Amphibious Operations, Joint Chiefs of Staff, January 4, 2019, validated without change on January 21, 2021, II-9. Similarly, the 2022 DOD China military power report notes: \u201cLarge scale amphibious invasion is one of the most complicated and difficult military operations, requiring air and maritime superiority, the rapid buildup and sustainment of supplies onshore, and uninterrupted support.\u201d7\u201cMilitary and Security Developments,\u201d 127.</p></div>\n            </div>\n        \n            <div class=\"card\">\n                <div id=\"6a6ebbb4-c983-5d7b-a469-f59c32b6bc94\"><div class=\"claim\" >Including external costs in the calculation for alternatives improves the economic competitiveness of new nuclear plants and other low-carbon sources of electricity.</div><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/economic-aspects/economics-of-nuclear-power\" id=a32b40a2-2804-5f90-96b9-9e3af7b4acfc>Economics of Nuclear Power - World Nuclear Association : https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/economic-aspects/economics-of-nuclear-power.

Building a large-scale nuclear reactor takes thousands of workers, huge amounts of steel and concrete, thousands of components, and several systems to provide electricity, cooling, ventilation, information, control and communication. To compare different power generation technologies the capital costs must be expressed in terms of the generating capacity of the plant (for example as dollars per kilowatt). Capital costs may be calculated with the financing costs included or excluded. If financing costs are included then the capital costs change materially for nuclear in relation to construction time of the plant and with the interest rate and/or mode of financing employed. Plant operating costs, which include the costs of fuel, operation and maintenance (O&M), and a provision for funding the costs of decommissioning the plant and treating and disposing of used fuel and wastes. Operating costs may be divided into \u2018fixed costs\u2019 that are incurred whether or not the plant is generating electricity and \u2018variable costs\u2019, which vary in relation to the output. Normally these costs are expressed relative to a unit of electricity (for example, cents per kilowatt hour) to allow a consistent comparison with other energy technologies. To calculate the operating cost of a plant over its whole lifetime (including the costs of decommissioning and used fuel and waste management), we must estimate the \u2018levelized\u2019 cost at present value. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) represents the price that the electricity must fetch if the project is to break even (after taking account of all lifetime costs, inflation and the opportunity cost of capital through the application of a discount rate). <span class=\"underline\">External costs to society from the operation, which in the case of nuclear power is usually assumed to be zero, but could include the costs of dealing with a serious accident that are beyond the insurance limit and in practice need to be picked up by the government.</span> The regulations that control nuclear power typically require the plant operator to make a provision for disposing of any waste, thus these costs are \u2018internalized\u2019 as part of operating costs (and are not external). <span class=\"underline\">Electricity generation from fossil fuels is not regulated in the same way, and therefore the operators of such thermal power plants do not yet internalize the costs of greenhouse gas emission or of other gases and particulates released into the atmosphere.</span> <span class=\"underline\">Including these external costs in the calculation for alternatives improves the economic competitiveness of new nuclear plants and other low-carbon sources of electricity.</span> Other costs such as system costs and nuclear-specific taxes.</p></div>\n            </div>\n        \n            <div class=\"card\">\n                <div id=\"a46f4fe4-6beb-5a1d-901a-ccee4731e186\"><div class=\"claim\" >Hybrid renewable energy systems exhibit higher seasonal complementary energy benefits than separate operations from a single energy source.</div><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-023-01587-1\" id=9be90094-318d-53f2-bb82-358c373524f2>Social, environmental, and economic consequences of integrating ... : https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-023-01587-1.

(2022) also studied complementary energy operations. They used remote sensing to predict energy operations under changing future climate scenarios. <span class=\"underline\">They found that complementary processes have higher power generation (5.46% increase) and higher reliability (5.13% increase) than single energy operations.</span> Modern power systems now greatly emphasize the complementing process of hybrid power plants (Ming et al. 2018). In photovoltaic/wind/diesel systems, diesel fuel is only used as a backup energy source when solar and wind energy cannot satisfy load demand (Mandal et al. 2018). Diesel generator sets ensure the system's reliability under extreme climate conditions and enhance the system's economy (Liu et al. 2022). Li et al. (2019) investigated water/photovoltaic complementarity operations. Energy systems operating in a complementary manner can adapt to variable climates when runoff is constrained while being supplemented by generation at the photovoltaic output and increasing the guarantee of meeting urban load requirements by 10.39%. In addition, Puspitarini et al. (2020) found that the increase in flux caused by the accelerated rate of ice melting prompted by rising temperatures was 25% photovoltaic and 75% hydroelectric. Climate change has a significantly less impact on the complementarity of water and solar energy because of the increased sensitivity to changes in temperature and precipitation. Furthermore, elevation, glacier cover, and basin structure have uncertain effects. Higher energy complementarity is well demonstrated compared to individual energy systems.</p></div>\n            </div>\n        \n            <div class=\"card\">\n                <div id=\"8b16072d-1150-5013-9911-8fd090e3cea9\"><div class=\"claim\" >Rising energy prices are significantly impacting household energy costs, particularly for vulnerable populations.</div><a class=\"citation\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/topics/global-energy-crisis\" id=87d44cc3-4af5-5827-8ffb-1c9c16e3f92b>Global Energy Crisis \u2013 Topics - IEA : https://www.iea.org/topics/global-energy-crisis.
